# ðŸŽ¯ PivotPanic

Alright, so here's the idea, I got bored of the usual "sorting visualisers" and thought,  
what if we turn it into a proper *race*?  

**PivotPanic** is a little game where it's just you, your mouse,  
and QuickSort itself, first one to get the array in order wins.  
It's fun, a bit stressful, and you actually learn how sorting works along the way.

## ðŸ•¹ How To Play

- **Click two bars** on the left to swap them.  
- The right side is QuickSort doing its thing, step by step.  
- Your mission: **finish sorting before the algorithm does.**
- Press **R** to reset and go again.
- Press **1 / 2 / 3** to change array size.
- **Spacebar** pauses the algorithm (cheeky way to buy some time ðŸ¤­).
